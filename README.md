# [PHP5 HTML5 Boilerplate](http://rajibmp.github.com/PHP5-HTML5-Boilerplate/)

PHP5 HTML5 Boilerplate is just extra PHP support added to the original HTML5 Boilerplate project for Rapid application development.

To read about original HTML5 Boilerplate check the  [Original Readme](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate).

This project is created for personal use at first, I just wanted to add HTML5 and Bootstrap for my project development, so, what could be the better way to integrate PHP and HTML5 then this ???  

My aim is to have a working skeleton for developing PHP projects easily which will also support latest  web technologies and Mobile, Handheld devices.
